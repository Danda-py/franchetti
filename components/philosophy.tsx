              The Franchetti family, with a solid agricultural tradition, has transitioned to sustainable production,
              becoming among the first in Valtellina to cultivate organic apples and kiwis. Daniele and Massimo lead the
              change towards agriculture that respects the environment, territory and consumers, on 22 hectares of land
              dedicated to apple trees, kiwis and fields.
            </p>
            <p className="text-balance">
              We believe that organic agriculture is not just a production method, but a lifestyle. It means listening
              to the land, respecting its rhythms, preserving its fertility for future generations.
            </p>
            <p className="text-balance">
              Our mission is to bring the genuineness of Valtellina to Italian tables, offering products that tell a
              story of passion, dedication and respect. Every jam, every fresh fruit is a bridge between the mountains
              and your home.

              <em>Because eating well means living better, and living better means respecting the world around us.</em>
